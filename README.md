## setting up:
change the id on the third line in presence.js to the client id of your app
```js
const id = '';
```

optionally, you can also change the refreshEvery variable to configure how often will it get your system stats and send them to discord, dont change this to something too low

## extra info:
this was originally made for linux, and thus, support for other operating systems isnt planned
afaik it should work with other oses just fine, you may have to run this as admin on windows

## contributing:
not necessary, but if you find a bug or want to add a tweak, feel free
